# üìã Booking Orchestrator Service

The **Booking Orchestrator** is the core component responsible for managing the complete lifecycle of a taxi booking initiated from the Priority Pass App. It validates requests, interacts with the Global Taxi platform, stores booking records, and emits relevant events.

This service is designed for high reliability, fault tolerance, and modular extensibility.
