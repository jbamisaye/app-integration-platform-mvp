## Use of AI Tools
I used **ChatGPT** strategically to accelerate tasks  

- **Architecture Design**: Used AI to validate my initial C4 diagrams for completeness and to refine component/service boundaries.
- **Prototype Development**: Used Copilot to scaffold React components, Tailwind utility usage, and generate sample data.
- **Documentation**: AI helped refine the language of architectural overviews documentation and README contents.
- **Judgment Applied**: All AI-generated outputs were reviewed, adapted, and rewritten where necessary to ensure alignment with project goals and clarity for technical and non-technical stakeholders.

This approach allowed me to move efficiently while maintaining full architectural ownership of the solution.
