## Architecture Overview

### System Design Principles
The architecture is designed to be scalable, fault-tolerant, loosely coupled, and cloud-native. It integrates the Priority Pass ecosystem with a third-party global taxi service to enable seamless traveler experiences before, during, and after airport visits.

### Technical Choices & Rationale
- **Microservices**: Encourages separation of concerns and service autonomy.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Enables loose coupling between orchestrator and downstream services.
- **Cloud-Native Stack (e.g., AWS Lambda, Step Functions)**: Improves elasticity and cost-efficiency.
- **API-first Design**: Supports partner extensibility (e.g., exposing APIs to Global Taxi and others).
- **Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)**: Enables repeatable and auditable deployments.
- **Single Shared Database**: Chosen for MVP simplicity; can evolve into per-service databases as the platform scales.
- **Serverless Architecture (AWS Lambda & Step Functions)**: Reduces operational overhead, enables scalable workflows, and aligns with a pay-per-use model ideal for unpredictable workloads.
- **PostgreSQL on AWS RDS**: Provides relational integrity and managed operations while fitting existing enterprise skills.
- **React + Tailwind CSS**: Enables rapid UI development with a clean and responsive user experience.

### Omissions & Trade-offs
- Real-time load balancing and taxi dispatch logic are offloaded to the global taxi provider.
- No implementation of retry logic, compensation flows, or SLA enforcement in this documentation.
- Security layers (e.g., WAF, DDoS protection) assumed but not diagrammed in detail.
- Assumes well-formed and reliable APIs from third-party partners.

### Future Enhancements
- Add AI-based personalization for departure time estimation.
- Introduce circuit breaker patterns for external API dependencies.
- Implement monitoring and observability using tools like CloudWatch, Datadog, or OpenTelemetry.
- Design for disaster recovery and region-level failover.
- Extend to include rail and airport parking options as part of the travel journey.
