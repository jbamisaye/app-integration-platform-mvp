## Architecture Overview

### System Design Principles
The architecture is designed to be scalable, fault-tolerant, loosely coupled, and cloud-native. It integrates the Priority Pass ecosystem with a third-party global taxi service to enable seamless traveler experiences before, during, and after airport visits.

### Technical Choices & Rationale
- **Microservices**: Encourages separation of concerns and service autonomy.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Enables loose coupling between orchestrator and downstream services.
- **Cloud-Native Stack (e.g., AWS Lambda, Step Functions)**: Improves elasticity and cost-efficiency.
- **API-first Design**: Supports partner extensibility (e.g., exposing APIs to Global Taxi and others).
- **Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)**: Enables repeatable and auditable deployments.
- **Single Shared Database**: Chosen for MVP simplicity; can evolve into per-service databases as the platform scales.
- **Serverless Architecture (AWS Lambda & Step Functions)**: Reduces operational overhead, enables scalable workflows, and aligns with a pay-per-use model ideal for unpredictable workloads.
- **PostgreSQL on AWS RDS**: Provides relational integrity and managed operations while fitting existing enterprise skills.
- **React + Tailwind CSS**: Enables rapid UI development with a clean and responsive user experience.

### Architectural Omissions & Trade-offs
- **Real-time dispatch & load balancing** are handled by the global taxi provider. The platform trusts their algorithms for optimal pickup experience.  
- **No retry logic or compensation flows** have been implemented in this MVP. Failed requests may result in a degraded user experience.  
- **Security assumptions are implicit**. WAF, API throttling, and DDoS protection are considered out-of-scope for this MVP but would be required in production.  
- **Third-party APIs are assumed reliable and stable**. Error handling for edge cases (e.g., rate limits, format inconsistencies) would need to be added.  
- **Simplified data sync logic** has been used. Lounge/taxi inventories are not updated in real-time but assumed to be synchronized periodically or via webhook triggers. 
- **Lack of user-facing fallback mechanisms**. If a booking fails or inventory is outdated, there is no automated feedback, suggestion, or admin intervention built-in yet.


### Future Enhancements
- Add AI-based personalization for departure time estimation.
- Introduce circuit breaker patterns for external API dependencies.
- Implement monitoring and observability using tools like CloudWatch, Datadog, or OpenTelemetry.
- Design for disaster recovery and region-level failover.
- Extend to include rail and airport parking options as part of the travel journey.
